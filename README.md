# GEARED

## This is the PyTorch implementation code for our paper: Efficient Unsupervised Graph Embedding with Attributed Graph Reduction and Dual-level Loss


## Environment Requirements

The code has been tested under Python 3.7.13. The required packages are as follows:

* Pytorch == 1.12.1
* Pytorch Geometric == 2.3.0


## Example : Cora dataset

```python
python train_GEARED.py --dataset Cora
```

The running result is:

...
